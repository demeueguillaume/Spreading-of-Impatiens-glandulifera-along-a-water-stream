This work aims to describe the behavior that a population of Himalayan balsamines (invasive plants) could have along a watercourse and to assess the impact of some kinds of intervention.

To do this, an advection-diffusion-reaction model is designed by considering different processes such as the transport of seeds by the current, their random dispersion, the population pressure and the exchange of seeds between the banks and the course of the watercourse.
